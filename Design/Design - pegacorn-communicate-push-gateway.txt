Setup a Sygnal server running in Docker using Kubernetes and Helm
=================================================================
These instructions will setup Sygnal to use SSL.
SQLite is being used but this will be changed to Postgres.

Docker Image
============
Docker Hub image "matrixdotorg/sygnal" is being used.

matrixdotorg - https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/sygnal

Development steps performed
===========================

From https://github.com/fhirfactory/pegacorn-communicate-serverside-push-gateway#setup

1) Copy https://github.com/fhirfactory/pegacorn-communicate-serverside-push-gateway/blob/master/sygnal.yaml.sample to aether-host-files\common\sygnal\sygnal.yaml

2) Modify the default file aether-host-files\common\sygnal\sygnal.yaml and commit to git.

	Changes made for TLS/SSL
		1) Added tls_certificate_path and change the value to:
			tls_certificate_path: "/var/lib/synapse/certificates/pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway.site-a.cer"
			
		2) Uncomment the tls_private_key_path and change the valaue to:
			tls_private_key_path: "/var/lib/synapse/certificates/pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway.site-a.key"

	Changes made to run in docker
		1) Change bind_addresses: from ['127.0.0.1'] to ['0.0.0.0']

3) Create your server certificate and key and make sure they are in pem format, and that the key does NOT have a passphrase:
Create-Cert-Set -certSubject 'pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway.site-a' -certPwd 'Password' -doNOTSecureKeyFileWithAPwd $True

One-off Setup
=============

1) Copy the certificates and config files to a host path location.  Remember this location as it is needed for the helm command.
    cp -rf /host_mnt/e/dev/aether-host-files/common/* /data/
	cp -rf /host_mnt/e/dev/aether-host-files/LocalWorkstations/* /data/
		
2) Add the following to the hosts file
	pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway.site-a
	
3) In a command prompt create the kubernetes secrets
	#NOTE: please ensure none of the secrets contain the ampersand character
	kubectl create secret generic pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway-secrets --from-literal=gcmSecret="<Get from lastpass.com>" --namespace=site-a
	
	
Build and deploy
================
E:
cd \dev\github\pegacorn-communicate-serverside-push-gateway
docker build --rm --build-arg IMAGE_BUILD_TIMESTAMP="%date% %time%" -t pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway:1.0.0-snapshot .
\helm\helm upgrade pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway-site-a --install --namespace site-a --set serviceName=pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway,basePort=30885,hostPathCerts=/data/certificates,hostPath=/data/sygnal,imageTag=1.0.0-snapshot,matrixLogLevel=DEBUG,androidAppId=au.gov.act.hd.aether,httpProxyHostAndPort=[Domain]%5C[UserId]:[Password]@[Proxy host]:[Proxy Port],numOfPods=1 helm


URL
===
Go to the below URL and if everything has been configured correctly then a page will appear containing: "Sygnal is running".
	https://pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway.site-a:30885/health
	
Testing
=======
Based on https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-pushers-set 
    
1.  Log in as a user and get the access_token to use as the bearer token for the remaining requests.
    e.g. POST https://pegacorn-communicate-roomserver.site-a:30880/_matrix/client/r0/login using POSTMAN
	{
	  "type": "m.login.password",
	  "identifier": {
		"type": "m.id.user",
		"user": "Jasen.SchremmerTMP"
	  },
	  "password": "[Password]",
	  "device_id": "IRIS",
	  "IGNORED_initial_device_display_name": "IRIS"
	} 
 
2.  POST to https://pegacorn-communicate-roomserver.site-a:30880/_matrix/client/r0/pushers/set
	{
		"lang": "en",
		"kind": "http",
		"app_display_name": "Lingo",
		"device_display_name": "Pixel 4",
		"app_id": "au.gov.act.hd.aether",
		"pushkey": "[Registration ID assigned by GCM to a single instance of a single application installed on a device]",
		"data": {
			"url": "https://pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway.site-a:30885/_matrix/push/v1/notify",
			"format": "event_id_only"
		}
	}

3.  Confirm the pusher has been registered for the user
    GET to https://pegacorn-communicate-roomserver.site-a:30880/_matrix/client/r0/pushers
	the response body should be like:
	{
		"pushers": [
			{
				"app_display_name": "Lingo",
				"app_id": "au.gov.act.hd.aether",
				"data": {
					"url": "https://pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway.site-a:30885/_matrix/push/v1/notify",
					"format": "event_id_only"
				},
				"device_display_name": "Pixel 4",
				"kind": "http",
				"lang": "en",
				"profile_tag": "",
				"pushkey": "[Registration ID assigned by GCM to a single instance of a single application installed on a device]"
			}
		]
	}	

4.  Use https://pegacorn-communicate-web.site-a:30890 and send a message to the user (make sure this user doesn't have an open Lingo session that is the active tab/app on a device), from another user

5.  Confirm in the pegacorn-communicate-push-gateway kubernetes pod logs that notifications are received.
    NOTE: the python libraries seem to be stuggling with authenticated proxies as I was getting
		Got Status: b'407' b'authenticationrequired' b'HTTP/1.0'
	even though HTTPS_PROXY was set correctly as http://[Domain]%5C[Your first name]%20[Your Surname]:[Password (URL encoded)]@[proxy host]:[proxy port].  It is working when no authentication is required.

To troubleshoot, you can
- search for /_matrix/push/v1/notify in the pegacorn-communicate-roomserver kubernetes pod logs
- GET https://pegacorn-communicate-roomserver.site-a:30880/_matrix/client/r0/notifications
